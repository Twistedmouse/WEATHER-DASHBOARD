### REPO: https://github.com/Twistedmouse/WEATHER-DASHBOARD
### DEPLOYED: https://twistedmouse.github.io/WEATHER-DASHBOARD/

<br>

<p>Disclaimer: When button is added too to search history, page must be refreshed to use the button a second time. Only the new button though. I know its to do with the way im fetching so I have a few plans to try to fix this when i have more time.

## The task at hand:

Build a weather app that can predict the weather for the current day and the next 5 following days, with cities searched saved into a search history section. 

<br>

### User Story

```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

### Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
```

## DESIGN: 

<p> My design was mostly based around something easy to look at for a daily use, with cloud like objects and sun flare. I'v used a 
moving gradient as my background, and large rounded shapes with a blur filter for something interesting and easy to look at as well. </p>

<br>

<p>Another slight style feature is depending on the uv severity will change the color of the index.</p>

<p>I have also added little bubbles around the page, that pulse in and out of the background to create a bit more atmosphere.  </p>

## future plans:
clear search text when searched

TODO: try a refresh function to fix the history load bug 
TODO: make auto load function to show last search result or current location.
TODO: make responsive 
todo location loads on page load
